Concept:

2 players compete to find the Ace in a randomized deck of cards with 3 cards on the table.
Conceptually, both players would put in 10 dollars and compete for the entire pot.

Getting the Ace on first pick results in 3 points (dollars).
Getting the Ace on second pick results in 2 points (dollars).
Last try (of course it's the Ace) results in 1 point (dollar).

The first player to get to 10 or higher points wins and receives ALL the money. Loser gets
nothing.

Randomized animated poker chips displayed on table will appear when there is a win.
